    <h3>
      <strong>*sigh*</strong> What is the punchline this time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>Digital Diary Cue</em> is not a social network, it's a social
      framework.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>*rolling eyes*</strong> How exciting...
    </h3>
    <p>
      Unlike your typical social website, this place is not all about you, nor
      having 500 or more people in your contacts. We want to help you actually
      build friendships. Each person you add to your contacts is considered a
      goal.
    </p>
    <h3>A goal?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. To keep a healthy relationship with someone usually you need to
      communicate and show that you care. Now it's easier than ever to keep
      track with your friends, yet more and more people are feeling lonely and
      isolated. Why? Because not everyone is interested of what happens in the
      life of someone they barely know. People want to be heard, not to listen
      how succesful their friends are. This is all you can do on social media -
      brag about yourself. You can't do that here. We want to give you the tools
      needed for connecting to the people you actually care about, or you want
      to know better.
    </p>
    <h3>How would you do that?</h3>
    <p>
      There are numerous books about socializing and talking to people. All time
      classics like Dale Carnegie's{" "}
      <em>„How to Win Friends and Influence People“</em> provide great insights.
      It is surprising that nobody brought those practices to our digital age.
      We have all needed tools - chat apps, orginizers, todo lists, calendaes,
      why not combine their power for this single purpose?
    </p>
    <h3>
      All my friends are already on some social network. I can't simply convince
      them to ditch their service for yours...
    </h3>
    <p>
      You don't have to! That's why many „Facebook killer“ services failed. They
      all did the same that Facebook did - better or not. Why would you need two
      of the same thing if what you have is already doing decent job? Here comes
      the beauty of our service - you can use it even if none of your friends is
      using it. Just add them by their email address and you are done. The only
      feature you won't be able to use is our chat app and its associated
      functions. Besides that, your experience will remain the same. When they
      join, you can connect and reuse all information you already have.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not trying to replace Facebook or other - actually we believe that
      we all could benefit from each other!
